As its writer, the concepts detailed herein are my own thoughts and positions, although my thoughts and my positions are inextricably enmeshed in the ancient traditions that make up the history of their philosophical examination inasmuch as those examinations inform the culture within and from which these concepts were inculcated into me and those around me. I thus make no claim to these ideas as my original creations, but rather attest to the intellectual intrigue they hold over me as subjects, lay claim to their practical relevance in ways of living, and, through their due consideration, satiate the expression of an all too curious mind.",
