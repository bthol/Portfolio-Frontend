        <p className="indent">I began creating art, as many do, when I was just a child, and from the very start I stood out. When asked to draw a tree, I made sure to include roots that submerged into the ground and resurfaced elsewhere and branches upon branches with scraggly details in the leaves. I have always been enamored by details, and, contrary to many people who do art when they are younger, my interest in art hasn't waned a bit. In fact, I'd wager that I get more interested in art the older I get, as I find more techniques and more mediums to express the urge to create.</p>
