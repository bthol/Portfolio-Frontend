# My Portfolio
Developer: Blake Thollaug

Description: I developed a portfolio website using the JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS technologies that is as easy on the eye as its development environment is manageable. This website has a template layout and style with content components for each page's content that are all served, but only conditionally rendered within the template, effectively permitting lightning fast client-side page handlng!
